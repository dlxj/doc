\noindent THIS BOOK was composed at Stanford University using the
\TeX\ system for technical text developed by D.\thinspace E. Knuth.
The mathematics is set in a new typeface called AMS~Euler (Version~2.1),
designed by Hermann Zapf for the American Mathematical Society.
The text is set in a new typeface called Concrete Roman and Italic,
a special version of Knuth's Computer Modern family with weights designed to
blend with AMS~Euler. The paper is 50-lb.-basis Clearfield Opaque, which
has a neutral pH and a life expectancy of several hundred years.
The offset printing and notch binding were done by Halliday Lithograph
Corporation in Hanover, Massachusetts.

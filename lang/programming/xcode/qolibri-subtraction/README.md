# qolibri EPWING dictionary viewer

This is a continuation of the [qolibri](http://qolibri.osdn.jp/)
[EPWING](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPWING) reader originally developed by
[BOP](https://osdn.net/users/bop/), then improved by
[Fujii Hironori](https://github.com/fujii),
[cybersphinx](https://github.com/cybersphinx), and
[Matthias von Faber](https://github.com/mvf).

BOP seems to have disappeared in 2009 and left no email address, so I would
like this to be new upstream repository.  Please send your fixes as PRs.
If you find a security bug, please report it like a regular bug.

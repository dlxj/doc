    "When we look at how likely different people from different classes and of different sex are to survive we can see a clear trend that the higher the class the higher the survival probability and also that women are much more likely to survive. But why is this the case. The answer is quite simple. When the Titanic began to sink women and children should go offboard in the lifeboats first before the men and the lower classes were not treated equally during the sinking as there were so many people in those classes that they could not be informed as well by the stewardesses so that it took mutch longer for them to get to the deck for rescue while first and second class passengers were already boarding the lifeboats and then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there. Another reason why there where so many people dying was the missing safety measures onboard the Titanic. For example there where not enough boats for the passengers to escape the ship. The lifeboats would have been only sufficient for half the people onboard and due to bad organization not all of them were completely filled so that even more than half of the passengers was left behind. One good aspect, however, is that the laws for a ships safety have become much more strict after this disaster. If you want to read about the sinking in detail have a look at this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic>"

    "Now to be able to train our model we want to convert our pandas dataframe into pytorch tensors. To do this we define the `dataframe_to_arrays` method which does the conversion to numpy arrays. To use the function we need to specify 3 kinds of columns namely input columns, categorical columns (columns that do not contain numbers but rather a string standing for a category) and output columns so that it can properly create a numpy array for input data and labels with all input data from the input columns (by first converting the categorical columns to numerical ones) and the labels from the output columns. Then we can easily convert them to pytorch tensors and specify the desired data types so that we are ready to define the model to be ready for the training on the data. Note also that the `normalize` parameter is set to `True` which makes the function normalize the input data by sqishing all values in a range between 0 and 1 with Min Max Normalization for the model to be able to better learn from the data as it is more uniform now."

This is necessary as then we can train the model to output a 1 when it thinks that the person would survive and a 0 when it does think that the person will not survive even though the model will probably never return a 1 or a 0 but it will predict a probability closer to 1 or 0 after some time of training. Moreover we define some other methods in our model for training and computing accuracies or printing them. One more thing to note is that as a loss function in `training_step` we use the Binary Cross Entropy loss.

    "After that now comes the cool part which is the actual training. For this we need to make a `fit_one_cycle` function to do the training for our model. Like any usual fit functions this one uses an optimizer to adjust the models parameters according to the gradients by backpopagating the loss backwards through the model with a certain learning rate. Here however there are some things about the fit function I want to point out that are not just the usual computing loss and then adjusting weights and biases thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning rate scheduling**: This is a technique replacing the fixed learning rate usually used by changing the learning rate after every batch of training. This can be done several ways but the way we will do it is with the **\"One Cycle Learning Policy\"** which starts with a smaller learning rate and then starts to gradually increase for the first 30% of epochs and then decreasing it again for optimal learning. For this scheduler we just need to set the maximum learning rate to which it will increase over time. If you want to go deaper into this topic I suggest you read this: <https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html>\n",
    "* **Weight decay / L2 Regularization**: Another thing we use is weight decay which adds the sum of the weights squared to the loss function so that bigger weights will be punished as bigger weights are usually a sign of overfitting. Thereby we make the model able to generalize better and achieve better results on unknown data as the weights are being lowered. See this for more information about weight decay: <https://towardsdatascience.com/this-thing-called-weight-decay-a7cd4bcfccab>\n",
    "* **Gradient clipping**: Lastly there is gradient clipping. This is actually quite simple but still very useful. The way gradient clipping works is that it just limits the gradient to a certain value so that if the gradient would take the model in the wrong direction it is limited to a certain size which means that the model can't be hurt due to large gradient values. Here is also an interesting post about it: <https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48>"

You can also see this when you look at the accuracy and the loss on the validation data and compare it to the one computed before the training. To verify this further let's plot the accuracies on the validation data over the course of the training phase as well as the loss on both training data and validation data. This last thing can also show us how much the model is overfitting since as soon as the training data loss still decreases but the validation data loss increases or stays the same we are overfitting since we are getting better and better on the training data but worse on the validation data which is definitely not what we want.

For example we can see that the class is associated with a negative value which is good since people from a class described with a higher number like class 3 were much less likely to survive. The next weight shows the extreme importance of the sex for the prediction as it is associated with the largest negative value which can be understood if you know that a man is represented with 1 and a woman with 0. What we can also deduce from the last weight is that the larger the fare paid the higher the survival probability which I think makes sense, too."

Now that I did this project from scratch I read about the pandas library and various of its functions so I was able to use this data for my project very well. I also learned quite a bit about data normalization.\n",

For example I read about why you would use 1 output neuron vs 2 output neurons for binary classification and came to the result that the usage of 1 output neuron is less prone to overfitting as it has less parameters which makes totally sense. This is also why I used this for my model with the Binary Cross Entropy. Morover I learned the math behind regularization to be able to better understand it and implement it which helped a lot when implementing regularization and choosing the weight decay hyperparameter.\n",

   Back when the world was new

   And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok
   It was a nasty place
   There was a mess
   whereever you stepped
   Where chaos reigned and earthquakes and volcanoes never slept
   And then along came Zeus
   He hurled his thunderbolt
   He zapped
   Locked those suckers in a vault
   They're trapped
   And on his own stopped chaos in its tracks
   And that's the gospel truth
   The guy was too type A to just relax
   And that's the world's first dish
   Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth

"Go The Distance"---《 Hercules OST | 大力士》
I have often dreamed of a far-off place 
where a great warm welcome will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
and a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be
I'll be there someday 
I can go the distance
I'll find my way 
If I can be strong 
I know every mile 
Will be worth my while
When I go the distance
I'll be right where I belong 

Down an unknown road 
You embrace my fate
Though that road may wander 
It will lead me to you 
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It might take a life time 
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back 
I can go the distance 
And I'll stay on track 
No I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope 
But I won't lose hope 
Till I go the distance 
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star 
I will go the distance 
I will search the world 
I will face its harms
I don't care how far
I can go the distance 
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face its harms
Till i find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

   "raindrops keep falling on my head"---《虎豹小霸王》
   Raindrops keep fallin' on my head 
And just like the guy whose feet are 
Too big for his bed 
Nothin' seems to fit 
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head 
They keep fallin' 

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun 
And I said I didn't like the way 
He got things done 
Sleepin' on the job 
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head 
They keep fallin' 

But there's one thing I know 
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me 
It won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me 

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head 
But that doesn't mean my eyes 
will soon be turnin' red 
Cryin's not for me 
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain 
By complainin' 
Because I'm free 
Nothin's worryin' me

Who's watchin' over me
Must be a guardian angel
I just need time to breathe
And give my life
The best of me

* Cross-word translation is used when **text can be selected and can be copied**
* Screenshot translation is recommended if it cannot be selected or copied
* Input translation is usually used when the text obtained by the above method is inaccurate

## Supported translation engines

Bob currently supports Youdao, Baidu, and Google Translate, as follows:

| Engine | English | English Phonetic | Chinese | Sentences | Supported Languages | Scientific Internet <sup>[1](#scientific-internet)</sup> |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Youdao | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 114 | - |
| Baidu | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 28 | - |
| Google CN | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 109 | - |
| Google | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 109 | Required |

Regarding the OCR interface used by screenshot translation, Baidu's own interface currently used by Baidu Translation. Other translations use the proper OCR interface, which will be changed later.

Google Translate cn and Google Translate have exactly the same results, except that Google Translate needs to be used on the Internet, but Google Translate cn does not.

**Note: If you are already online on the Internet, Google Translate may not be available. In addition, if your scientific Internet connection is not configured properly, it will cause other translation interfaces such as Tao, Baidu translation speed to drop significantly, and even fail. Please use PAC mode instead of global mode.**

<a name="#scientific-internet"><sup>[1]</sup></a> _Scientific internet_ is
a term often used in China to express the need for a VPN to bypass government
blocked websites such as Google.

## Common Problems

<h6>Wording translation does not get text</h6>
<details>
<summary>Can't get the text for the wording translation?</summary><br>
<p>
<p>The wording translation is essentially issuing the <code>⌘ + C</code> key combination to copy the selected text, and then get the text from the clipboard for translation. Please ensure that the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>Text selected</li>
<li>Accessibility permissions are enabled (there is an opening method in front of the article)</li>
<li>Selected text can be copied</li>
<li>The shortcut for copying text in current software is <code>⌘ + C</code> (Some software <code>⌘ + C</code> have different meanings)</li>
<li>Current software can copy text quickly after pressing <code>⌘ + C</code> (for example, the "Books" app that comes with the system will be stuck after pressing <code>⌘ + C</code> After a while, it is likely to lead to failure in word picking)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some software or websites will append some information after copying the text, so sometimes the obtained text and the selected one may be different.</p>
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Nothing happens when I click the read button?</summary><br>
<p>After clicking the read button, a network request will be made for audio playback. If there is no response, the sentence may be too long and the loading will be slow. Of course, it may also be a BUG. Later, I will consider some UI tips after clicking.</p>
</details>

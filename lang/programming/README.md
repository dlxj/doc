# Mathematica-Voice-Kernel-Codes
These are the kernel codes of the Mathematica-Voice Resampling Engine.  
Using these codes, you can easily create your own singing synthesizer application such as UTAU through Mathematica.  
To correctly run all the codes, please update your Mathematica beyond version 11.0.  
If you are interested in the details, you can contact me on Bilibili.
